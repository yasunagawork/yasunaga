    <div class = "content"> <p> &nbsp &nbsp Romantic comedy is a training model. These characters (artificial romantic interests) acts in instances, scenarios, circumstances, demonstrating how our personas are supposed to react and expect from romantic relationships. Misunderstanding and miscommunication play an important roll in generating a comedic plot.
     <br> <br>


        &nbsp &nbsp AI acting cut1 was a speculative and imaginative exercise of myself acting as an AI. By embodying AI object recognition software as a persona and a character, I try to see shapes, color, texture, and relationships in limited resolution and memory. As if I was born yesterday and was given the references to navigate. I attempted to see the world through trained models (premises) to limit the dimensions of my engagement and expand the poetic potential. Within the simulated alien activity, I staged my misunderstanding to generate a comedic act that humanizes the AI character.
