       <p>
        <b>The stay</b> is a name of a installation - activities being witnessed revolving around migrations of solar electronic bugs and the caretaker on a chosen site. <br><br>

        Activities are pronounced and recorded as “instances” in following categories; 1) Zone - formations of bugs 2) formation of practice wear 道着 made of chainmail 3) impression and the markings 4) chimeras  5) notational drawing 6) facilitative tool. <br><br>

        Many instances continuously change during the time of the exhibition. Documented series of instance here were recorded as of 3/28/2022 and was part of thesis <a href="http://nextdaysoup.yaleschoolofart.org/">exhibition at Yale School of Art</a>. Particular instance reoccurs and others are recorded only once; some of are only witnessed in a particular time of the day. <br><br>

        This gregarious swarm is called くっつき虫 - ( sticky bug)  and there are 441 of them as of 3/25/2022. (derived from the parent project -<a href="http://electronicentomology.com"> electronic entomology</a>) This specie possess on each of their body, small earth magnet which affords them to perch on any steel objects. Caretaker come into the site and wear the practice wear made of chainmail to equip the body with the swarm. Swarm is walked to a new location, lands to new steal object which then become a new instance. This migration happens everyday. Since the exhibition, some of them through various hands, migrated to steel objects of public spaces and private homes.

     <p><small>"In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at a target, creating a hole every ten centimeters. Now suppose the surface of the target is inhabited by intelligent, two-dimensional creatures. Their scientists, after observing the universe, discover a great law: “There exists a hole in the universe every ten centimeters.” They have mistaken the result of the marksman’s momentary whim for an unalterable law of the universe.  The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey, having observed this pattern to hold without change for almost a year, makes the following discovery: “Every morning at eleven, food arrives.” On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at eleven, food doesn’t arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock" (Liu 113)</small></p>
