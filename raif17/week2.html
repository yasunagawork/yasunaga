      <h1>01/27: RESEARCH PRESENTATIONS</h1>
      <h2>LATE START!</h2>
      <p>The only thing we have on our schedule for today are the introductory presentations by each of you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Due to the snow, we'll be starting at 11:00.</em></li>
        <li>Please project on the screen up front. You can use the teaching computer, but have your files ready to transfer at the start of class.</li>
        <li>If you'd like to use your own computer and need sound, make sure to install the Steinberg USB audio drivers from <a href="http://www.yamahaproaudio.com/global/en/downloads/firmware_software/yamaha_steinberg_usb_driver/">here</a>.</li>
        <li>(Sound from HDMI will also play through the projector, you just won't have much control.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just a reminder...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5-10 minutes talking time.</li>
        <li>No laptops or phones in the audience while someone else is presenting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>POST-PRESENTATIONS</h2>
      <p>I'm available to talk to anyone who would like to discuss or brainstorm project plans in greater detail. <em>Just let me know...</em> Otherwise, you're free to leave.</p>

      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>PROJECT DEVELOPMENT (6 HOURS)</h2>
      <p>Begin working on your project. This might be...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>More brainstorming until you have a direction to move in for the first project.</li>
        <li>Continue researching precedents and technical needs.</li>
        <li>Prepare materials or gather supplies.</li>
        <li>Start working. Play around with the materials. Begin preliminary prototypes. Get your hands dirty. Hit the ground running!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Next week is a studio session, so make sure that you come prepared to do something constructive (and project related!) with that time. <em>I'll also be checking progress, so make sure that you can demonstrate the expected amount of time/effort.</em>em></p>
