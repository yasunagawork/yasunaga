      <p>Welcome back everyone!</p>

      </ol>

      <h2>INTRODUCTIONS/SHARE SOME WORK</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you all know each other?</li>
        <li>Everyone should have documentation of 2 recent IA-related projects to show.</li>
        <li>Let's go around the room and take a look at what everyone has brought.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>REMAINDER: BRAINSTORMING</h2>
      <p>It's possible that you may still not know exactly what you want to work on. That's ok.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You all have skills and experiences that are valuable.</li>
        <li>If you think you might be interested in collaborating, let's begin throwing some ideas around.</li>
        <li>If you are 100% sure that you do not want to collaborate on the first project, you may leave.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>PREPARE SHORT INTRODUCTORY PRESENTATION</h2>
      <p>The short presentation you give next week will consist of two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A self-introduction in which you show some things you are currently interested in.</li>
        <li>1 or 2 rough ideas of something you'd like to work on during the first half of this semester.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>DETAILS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Total length: 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Format: Anything goes (Powerpoint/Google Slides, InDesign/Illustrator/Word document, webpage, video, stack of files) as long as the material is coherently organized! <strong>You must arrive to class prepared.</strong></li>
        <li>Tone: Casual but serious. Think hard about what you're showing, but you don't need to script everything out or use cue cards.</li>
        <li>Due: Next week at 9am (Mandatory attendance. Don't be late!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CONTENT</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Research 2 things that represent some of your current interests. This might be the creative work of others (art/design/games/whatever) or something else you find personally inspiring. Do these things currently inform your creative practice in some sort of way?</li>
        <li>What would you like to make next? You can be general or specific about this. Try not to think too hard about the future, think about right now. What excites you? What's interesting? What seems enjoyable?</li>
        <li>Find 2 examples of work that has already been done (by someone else) which is somehow related to what you'd like to make. Why these particular things?</li>
        <li>Anything else you think is personally relevant. Don't feel like you have to fill the full 10 minutes... you don't! :)</li>
      </ol>
