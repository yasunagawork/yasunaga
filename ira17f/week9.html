      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>DOCUMENTATION (DUE BY START OF CLASS NEXT WEEK)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete documentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PREPARE BRIEF PRESENTATION FOR PROJECT 2</h2>
      <p>The short presentation you give next week will consist of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Research &amp; planning related to something you'd like to work on during the second half of this semester.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>DETAILS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Total length: 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Format: Anything goes (Powerpoint/Google Slides, InDesign/Illustrator/Word document, webpage, video, stack of files) as long as the material is coherently organized! <strong>You must arrive to class prepared.</strong></li>
        <li>Tone: Casual but serious. Think hard about what you're showing, but you don't need to script everything out or use cue cards.</li>
        <li>Due: Next week at 9am (Mandatory attendance. Don't be late!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CONTENT</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What would you like to make next? You can be general or specific about this. Try not to think too hard about the future. What excites you? What's interesting? What seems enjoyable?</li>
        <li>Is this is a continuation of Project 1? If so, what are your plans to improve on or build upon the work that you have already done? Please focus on providing details relevant to the work you will be doing, not what has already been done and be very specific. (Examples: Production/playtesting schedule, development of concept art, restate/clarify project goals based on feedback from Project 1) </li>
        <li>Research interests: Provide at least 2 examples of things which represent current interests relevant to your second project. Think of this as background material. How do these inform your work?</li>
        <li>Research precedents: At minimum, you should show 2 examples of existing work (produced by someone else) which are directly related to what you'd like to make. Why these particular things?</li>
        <li>Anything else you think is important. Don't feel like you have to fill the full 10 minutes... you don't! :)</li>
