      <ul>


      <li>11/22 prototype due</li>
      <li>12/6 presentation</li>
      <li>12/13 Documentation due</li>

      </ul>
    
    </p>
    <br>


    <h2> On Prototyping</h2>

    <p>Next week we will be reviewing your prototype for your project. I want you to consider a few things towards next week to get most out from the feedback.</p>

    <p>

      <ol>
        <li>Prototype does not have to look slick! It is a model of your project so we can discuss what is working</li>
        <li>Identify the important part of your project and decide what part you want people to experience</li>
        <li>Prepare questions to ask</li>

        <li>Take a break! We make some mistake often when we are working on the same thing for too long. Fresh eye always helps to see a problem</li>

        <li>Break it down. Make small part of your project work first, then scale it up!</li>

        <li>Iterate your idea</li>

        <li>Try not to get confined by the tech and stay flexible with your experiments!</li>

    <h2> Troubleshooting Checklist</h2>

    <p> 

      When we work with electronics, <strong>do not expect everything to work on a first try!</strong> There are times that things work on a first try but always <strong>expect a problem.</strong><br>
      Troubleshooting is an important and an essential skill for working with electronics.<br>
      Here are some guidelines for troubleshooting projects. Ask few questions to yourself to start this process.

      <ol>
        <li>Is this problem occurring for the first time? </li>
        <li>What was the last thing you change in your project?</li>

        <li>Are there a part that's working? If so what is working and what is not?</li>
        <li>Based on these questions, what do you think might be happening?</li>
        
        
      </ol><br>

      </p>

      <p> 
        Now, when you get to troubleshooting with details of your project, I want you to pay attention to a couple of things.
      </p>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>If anything is too hot to touch, smells burned, or if you see smoke, unplug everything and identify where in your project is it coming from. <strong>Heat is bad in most cases!</strong></li>
        <li>Test your components from one end or another so you can eliminate working part of circuit as you go</li>

        <li>Take a break! We make some mistake often when we are working on the same thing for too long. Fresh eye always helps to see a problem</li>

        <li>Break it down. Make small part of your project work first, then scale it up!</li>
        
        
      </ul><br>
    </p>

     <p><img src="images/trouble.png" width = "500px"></p><br>

     <p>
      Above is an example set up for a testing sequence.<br> We will start at the plug and work our way up to the sensors and outputs.<br>
      Use a multimeter to test the circuit! Here is a refresher on <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter"> how to use a multimeter</a></p>


      <h3> 1: Wall</h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Test if the outlet you are using is working by plugging other electronics in like lamps</li>
        <li>Try another outlet</li>

        <li>If you are using power strips or surge protectors, make sure they are turned on</li>

        <li>Test any extension cords you are using</li>
        <li>Some outlet has "reset" button</li>
        
        
      </ul><br>
    </p>

      <h3> 2: Power Supply / Battery</h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your power supply is plugged in firmly to wall and arduino</li>
         <li>Check polarity</li>
        <li>Check the label and make sure it is meant to provide in between 6V and 15V if you are plugging into 2.1 mm center positive plug</li>

        <li>Use multimeter to check the output voltage</li>

        <li>Use another power supply</li>

        <li>Make sure battery is not dead</li>
      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 3: USB cord</h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>It is more common then we expect that bad USB cable causes issues.</li>
        <li>if you are having a trouble uploading to the board even if you have selected right port and the board, check USB cable first.
        <li> Swap out the USB cable to make sure cable is good. If not <strong>throw it away!</strong></li>
        <li>USB C to USB adapter can cause issues connecting to your arduino. Try another adapter</li>
        
      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 4: Computer / Code </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you have selected right board to upload in arduino software (Tools --> Board)</li>
        <li> Make sure you have selected the port you are connecting (Tools --> Serial Port)</li>
        <li> Try to load simple sketch like Blink.ino sketch from example and see if it uploads</li>
        <li> Restart arduino software</li>
        <li> Restart computer</li>
        <li> Come back to coding troubleshooting after you confirm that arduino is working with simple code</li>

      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 5: Arduino </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure On LED is lighting up. If On LED goes out when you plug something into arduino, that's a bad sign (likely there is wiring issue). Unplug them and see the On LED comes back up.</li>
        <li>Make sure no conductive objects are touching on the bottom of the board</li>
        <li> Press "Reset" button </li>
        <li> Try to load simple sketch like Blink.ino sketch from example and make sure TX and RX LEDs are lighting up during upload</li>
        <li> Double check all connection and there is no short circuit</li>
        <li>make sure there is no heat coming off of any pat of arduino.
        <li>Remove all connection except for USB and try to upload Blink sketch</li>
        <li>Try another arduino</li>

      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 6: Wires to the sensors </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bad solder can cause connection issues. Make sure your soldering connections are attached well</li>
        <li> Check continuity from one end to soldered connection to the sensor using multimeter</li>
        <li> <strong>Discard any wire that fails continuity test</strong></li>

      </ul><br>
    </p>


    <h3> 7: Sensors / Components </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check if it's soldered well</li>
        <li> If you are using Digital input, upload the simplest sketch like Examples > Digital > Button</li>
        <li> If you are using Analog input, upload the simplest sketch like Examples > Analog > AnalogInput</li>
        <li> Use serial monitor and serial plotter </li>
        <li>Swap out for identical sensor </li>

      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 8: wire to the output </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Again, bad solder can cause connection issues. Make sure your soldering connections are attached well</li>
        <li> Check continuity</li>


      </ul><br>
    </p>

    <h3> 9: output </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check if it's wired correctly</li>
        <li>Power it without arduino if you can</li>
        <li> swap it with another one</li>

      </ul><br>
    </p>


    <h3> 10: coding </h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>always start small. When you have multiples input and output, start with one input one outputs</li>
        <li>Make sure you have main structure down --- void setup()  void loop() </li>
        <li> make sure there is no duplicate variables</li>
        <li> make multiple sketches in stages of your project</li>
        <li> comment your code!</li>
        <li> Use serial monitor </li>
        <li> Always make sure your physical part of your project (circuits) are connected correctly and working before you tackle coding problem</li>



      </ul><br>
